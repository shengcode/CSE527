    "## Problem 1: Tiny Image Representation + Nearest Neighbor Classifier\n",
    "{25 points} You will start by implementing the tiny image representation and the nearest neighbor classifier. They are easy to understand, easy to implement, and run very quickly for our experimental setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"tiny image\" feature is one of the simplest possible image representations. One simply resizes each image to a small, fixed resolution. You are required to **resize the image to 16x16**. It works slightly better if the tiny image is made to have zero mean and unit length (normalization). This is not a particularly good representation, because it discards all of the high frequency image content and is not especially invariant to spatial or brightness shifts. We are using tiny images simply as a baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nearest neighbor classifier is equally simple to understand. When tasked with classifying a test feature into a particular category, one simply finds the \"nearest\" training example (L2 distance is a sufficient metric) and assigns the label of that nearest training example to the test example. The nearest neighbor classifier has many desirable features — it requires no training, it can learn arbitrarily complex decision boundaries, and it trivially supports multiclass problems. It is quite vulnerable to training noise, though, which can be alleviated by voting based on the K nearest neighbors (but you are not required to do so). Nearest neighbor classifiers also suffer as the feature dimensionality increases, because the classifier has no mechanism to learn which dimensions are irrelevant for the decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Report your classification accuracy on the test sets and time consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints**:\n",
    "- Use [cv2.resize()](https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/modules/imgproc/doc/geometric_transformations.html#resize) to resize the images;\n",
    "- Use [NearestNeighbors in Sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neighbors.html) as your nearest neighbor classifier."

    "## Problem 2: Bag of SIFT Representation + Nearest Neighbor Classifer\n",
    "{35 points}\n",
    "After you have implemented a baseline scene recognition pipeline it is time to\n",
    "move on to a more sophisticated image representation — bags of quantized SIFT\n",
    "features. Before we can represent our training and testing images as bag of\n",
    "feature histograms, we first need to establish a vocabulary of visual words. We\n",
    "will form this vocabulary by sampling many local features from our training set\n",
    "(10's or 100's of thousands) and then cluster them with k-means. The number of\n",
    "k-means clusters is the size of our vocabulary and the size of our features. For\n",
    "example, you might start by clustering many SIFT descriptors into k=50 clusters.\n",
    "This partitions the continuous, 128 dimensional SIFT feature space into 50\n",
    "regions. For any new SIFT feature we observe, we can figure out which region it\n",
    "belongs to as long as we save the centroids of our original clusters. Those\n",
    "centroids are our visual word vocabulary. Because it can be slow to sample and\n",
    "cluster many local features, the starter code saves the cluster centroids and\n",
    "avoids recomputing them on future runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are ready to represent our training and testing images as histograms of\n",
    "visual words. For each image we will densely sample many SIFT descriptors.\n",
    "Instead of storing hundreds of SIFT descriptors, we simply count how many SIFT\n",
    "descriptors fall into each cluster in our visual word vocabulary. This is done\n",
    "by finding the nearest neighbor k-means centroid for every SIFT feature. Thus,\n",
    "if we have a vocabulary of 50 visual words, and we detect 220 distinct SIFT\n",
    "features in an image, our bag of SIFT representation will be a histogram of 50\n",
    "dimensions where each bin counts how many times a SIFT descriptor was assigned\n",
    "to that cluster. The total of all the bin-counts is 220. The histogram should be\n",
    "normalized so that image size does not dramatically change the bag of features\n",
